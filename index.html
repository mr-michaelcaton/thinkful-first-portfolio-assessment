        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Michael. 👋🏿 I am extraordinarily lucky to wake up every day and do what I do.</p>
        <p>I work with communities and organizations to fulfill their aspirations through spatial experiences and
          strategic engagements. I lead an extraordinary team of designers - nurturing their growth and focusing their
          drive to seize the future of architecture. I work with executive leaders at the intersection of product,
          culture, and talent to drive organizational change.</p>
        <p>I love what I do.</p>
        <p>I reside and work in New York City with my partner and two children.</p>
