        <p>Hi! I'm Michael. 👋🏿 I am extraordinarily lucky to wake up every day and do what I do.
<br><br>
I work with communities and organizations to fulfill their aspirations through spatial experiences and strategic engagements. I lead an extraordinary team of designers - nurturing their growth and focusing their drive to seize the future of architecture. I work with executive leaders at the intersection of product, culture, and talent to drive organizational change.</p>
<p>I love what I do.</p>
          <p>I reside and work in New York City with my partner and two children.</p>
